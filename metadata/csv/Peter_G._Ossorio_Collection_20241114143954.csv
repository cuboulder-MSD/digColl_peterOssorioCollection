He uses a variety of personal anecdotes. 00:11:48 Ossorio discusses Charles E. Osgood's Measurement of Meaning. 00:16:07 Ossorio discusses his early post-graduate work with data and how it affected his working relationship with measurement. 00:19:08 Ossorio discusses classification space research to solve some of the issues he was having with his post-graduate data work which he coined the vindication paradigm research. 00:21:06 Ossorio discusses his practice of critique at that time. He mentions Intention by Elizabeth Anscombe as a work that influenced his understanding of behavior and critique. Ossorio connects Intentions and a variety of other works that touched on behavior and critique to how he came to write his monograph The Behavior of Persons. 00:25:59 Ossorio discusses his work since then as an elaboration of that basic schema - of 8 behaviors in place of five. He discusses his conversations with a variety of colleagues and students. 00:27:54 Ossorio discusses how he applied his work on schema and behavior to language and activity description. 00:29:56 Ossorio discusses his research into maxims as it relates to his work in Persons. 00:32:07 Ossorio discusses Notes on Behavior Description and how the work relates to maxims and forms of description. 00:35:15 Ossorio discusses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aid the organization of the accumulated knowledge of psychologists. 00:38:37 Ossorio discusses his time at Rutgers and his work with depression as a status dynamic. This led to him writing his work Status Dynamics and Psychotherapy which outlines his 95 status dynamic maxims. 00:41:56 Ossorio Shifts the lecture back to Intention and his work associated with the concept. 00:42:37 Ossorio discusses his work ""What Actually Happens"": The Representation of Real-world Phenomena and its relationship to his previous research and explanation on the notions of objects, processes, events, and states of affairs. 00:45:51 Ossorio discusses his investigation into why one can address objects, processes, events, and states of affairs the exact same way and ties it to his work in transition rules. 00:49:33 Ossorio discusses the logical relation between behavior and world. He discusses information systems and simulation research as the area in which the real world and behavior is being researched. 00:51:15 Ossorio shifts the conversation back to his book ""What Actually Happens"": The Representation of Real-world Phenomena. He analyses the title to express the meaning of his work as an exploration on concepts. 00:53:54 Ossorio discusses the idea that a world is logically required for behavior which he connects to world construction. He connects this idea to incomplete knowledge of the world and distortion of reality. 00:56:27 Ossorio discuss status dynamic maxims that deal with these world distortions. 00:57:37 Ossorio discusses the cotification of these ideas in case formulations. 00:58:06 Ossorio circles back to an anecdotal experience with Rorschach tests and psychodynamic theory. He discusses the issue of communicating when one's audience foundationally understands based on different theories. 01:03:03 Ossorio connects Rorschach’s to status dynamics, descriptions, and redescriptions through a variety of examples. 01:09:54 Ossorio discusses observation and inference as a central part of clinical activity. 01:13:14 An audience member asks about academic psychologists versus clinical psychologists. Ossorio discusses his dislike of academia and his leaning towards clinical psychology and why. 01:18:09 Ossorio uses an anecdote about a child growing up in an alcoholic family to describe descriptive psychologists and their environment. 01:19:44 Ossorio describes the various directions in which descriptive psychology can move. 01:20:33 The unidentified speaker from the start of the records asks Ossorio about language and descriptive psychology. 01:23:30 [Unintelligible audience comment] Ossorio discusses information systems and systematic approaches to language and experience. 01:25:16 An audience member asks about critique. 01:30:45 an audience member asks critique in psychological review.

He then introduces Peter Ossorio. 00:01:54 Ossorio begins his lecture introducing his topic on the human condition and the consideration of the domain of persons and behaviors. He explains that his lecture will be split into three sections 00:03:36 To lead into the first section Ossorio discusses how he became interested in the notion of experience via ""The Leap Into Space"" and the [Optimum Mix Problem]. He then connects experience to artificial intelligence, computers, and robots and the notion of making them as human-like as possible. 00:08:13 Ossorio discusses what it means to be a person in connection with experience and robotics. He discusses descriptive psychology and experience to provide examples of personhood. 00:13:07 Ossorio discusses central terms of consciousness: experience, consciousness, awareness, feeling, perception, and intuition. He discusses these terms usability in relationship with experience through the need to clarify certain uses of the terms. He provides three cases/examples. 00:25:06 Ossorio discusses psychology's machine theories of mental processes and experiences integral part of the process. 00:27:45 Ossorio discusses the television model. 00:30:46 Ossorio discusses the issues with dispensing of experience. He discusses how there is no way, by default, to describe experience through examples. 00:39:21 Ossorio discusses disclaimers in the context of experience and human interaction. 00:41:48 Ossorio discusses potentially what can take experiences place in the human condition and if there is any real difference between these mechanisms. 00:46:16 pauses his lecture to take audience questions. An audience member makes a comment on writer's use of metaphor and disclaimers as means to describe experience. 00:47:50 An audience member asks a clarification questions about the way people describe experience. 00:49:48 An audience member asks a clarification about the difference between a person and an organism per an earlier example given by Ossorio. 00:50:34 Ossorio instructs for a break in the lecture. 00:50:58 The recording picks up after the break. Ossorio begins discussing connecting experience to cognition and how connecting experience to behavior is a better metric from which to work. 00:56:03 An audience member asks about reconstructing/perceiving the world. 00:58:43 Ossorio discusses what people see when they observe the world: objects, processes, events, states of affairs. He discusses the history of philosophy backing up his assertion of the essential elements that make up the world people observe. 01:03:52 Ossorio focuses the conversation back to behavior. He uses the example of being deserted on a deserted island and adds variables to discuss behavior. 01:09:33 Ossorio discusses how the real-world effects behavior. 01:11:34 The unidentified man from the start of the recording begins passing around a paper to the audience at Ossorios direction. 01:13:48 Ossorio begins discussing the handout which outlines a ""simple [formal] system"". He discusses objects, processes, events, and states of affairs as not independent of one another which is why they are they are called transitionals. 01:18:16 Ossorio discusses the real world and limiting cases. 01:20:05 Ossorio discusses states of affairs as a limited case and as a transitional. Ossorio connects his analysis of state of affairs back to the idea of the real world. 01:23:18 An audience member asks a clarification question about one of Ossorio's examples. Another audience member, piggybacking off that question, asks a clarification question. 01:23:57 Ossorio discusses children language learning as the closest example. 01:25:16 Ossorio circles back to the idea that objects, processes, events, and states of affairs are like booking keeping systems for behavior classification. Ossorio draws a diagram on the blackboard to explain in more detail. 01:31:24 Ossorio discusses the 95 maxims focusing on person and world. 01:33:09 An audience member asks about the diagram and clarification of the schema. 01:34:00 Ossorio ends the lecture for a break before the last section of the lecture. 01:34:39 End of recording.","Segment sequence","","Psychology","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1081447","Computer programming","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/872390","Artificial intelligence--Data processing","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/817255","Experience","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/918379","Human behavior","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/962811","","","","","Ossorio, Peter G.","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/16889","Wittgenstein, Ludwig, 1889-1951","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/32844","","","","","","","","","","","U183071307182_narv_ossorioPeter_37-28_societyForDescriptivePsychologyPart1_a.mp4","https://ark.colorado.edu/ark:/47540/3v1j321861rz","COU:3855 | Box: 37 | Tape: 28","","The Society for Descriptive Psychology Master, Part 2","constituent","U183071307116_narv_ossorioPeter_37-29_societyForDescriptivePsychologyPart2_a.mp4","Spring, 2024","video/mp4","https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/video/mp4","reformatted digital","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

She then introduces Peter Ossorio. 00:00:28 Ossorio introduces the topic of self-knowledge and how to make robots more human-like through means of artificial intelligence (AI). 00:01:40 Ossorio begins a demonstration outlining a problem of self-knowledge highlighting the disproportionate relationship of a person being both a Knower and Known. Ossorio discusses how philosophers, to account for this inequality, created a Transcendental Knower or ""the organism"" as coined by Carl Rogers. 00:04:03 Ossorio discusses the framework of the Observer and Observed. Ossorio uses this framework to discusses an example: a picture of Winston Churchill as it related to heuristics. 00:07:27 Ossorio gives another example through the notion of the self. He highlights the concept that people are ""irrationally biased in their own favor"" through his example and by the Freudian Ego Defense Mechanism precedent. Ossorio continues to discuss theory about the self. 00:11:42 Ossorio discusses informal data regarding the self and answers to the questions ""what kind of person are you?"" and ""who are you?"". 00:18:05 Ossorio brings the lecture back to the main theme of self-knowledge and its connection to status in the 'real world'. Ossorio discusses how status affects relationships and roles. 00:22:21 Ossorio discusses identification via the self. 00:27:15 Ossorio discusses the notion of knowing the self. He brings up the topic of domains, relationships, possibilities, behaviors, and past and future history and their incompleteness. 00:31:22 Ossorio discusses the what’s implied when a person says ""I know"" and how it related to the Observer and Observed framework. He discusses how the clinical solution to wondering who one is to ""outgrow"" the question. 00:35:12 Ossorio discusses the consequences to the definition of these frameworks and how they affect relationships, status, and self-knowledge. 00:41:00 Ossorio discusses what conditions are necessary for self-knowledge to actually change through a variety of examples: ""I just couldn't do it"" and ""I could never do that"" versus trying despite that or doing the unthinkable. 00:50:28 Ossorio shifts the lecture to therapy and how it is an effective vehicle towards making people confront the unthinkable.

He goes through three examples. 00:10:39 Ossorio discusses two more examples that are less familiar than the previous three. 00:13:16 Ossorio discusses why these examples should ""touch a nerve"" regarding hard data versus interpretation. 00:14:31 Ossorio discusses how to shift hard data to something useful by connecting that to redescription and the lack of significance. 00:17:17 Ossorio circles the conversation back to the issues of uselessness and imbuing hard data with meaning by introducing context to create interpretation. 00:19:22 Ossorio discusses interpretation an it's relationship to methodology. 00:22:34 Ossorio discusses intermediate descriptions as a means to make the final description easier to find and make sense of. 00:23:39 Ossorio discusses data reduction as it relates to mid-level descriptions and methodological schemes. 00:29:04 Ossorio discusses the information explosion and its connection to astronomy. He discusses how the volume of data in this explosion is overwhelming large and therefore unusable. 00:33:42 Ossorio discusses why that data and classification scheme is ultimately important to the people collecting it and presumably using it. He discusses the tuning fork diagram. 00:38:59 Ossorio discusses these morphological classifications. 00:41:54 Ossorio discusses how difficult it is to classify from the hard data to the mid-level description. He discusses how computer programming and automation via pattern recognition operations can help interpret data. 00:46:33 Ossorio brings the conversation back to redescription structures. 00:47:00 Ossorio writes ""Human Judgement methods / Syntactic Pattern Recognition ] Redescription structure” on the black board. 00:47:57 Ossorio discusses Human Judgement methods and Syntactic Pattern Recognition through an example of library catalogues and other organization and sorting methods that utilize automation that relies on redescription. 00:54:58 Ossorio takes an audience question for clarification. Ossorio continues to explain redescription. 00:56:06 Ossorio continues to discuss automatically generated redescriptions and how this method can work for the tuning form diagram (images) over words like in a library. 01:00:24 Ossorio discusses the difficulties of degraded data on this automatic sorting system. 01:02:58 an audience member asks Ossorio about another application of this methodology. 01:04:03 An audience member asks about how close people are to building an automatic sorting system as Ossorio described. 01:04:29 An audience asks about fractal theory. 01:04:58 Ossorio ends his lecture. 01:05:17 End of recording.","Segment sequence","","Redescription","local","Computer programming","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/872390","Artificial intelligence--Data processing","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/817255","Tuning fork diagram","local","Outer space","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1243437","Descriptive psychology","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/891132","","","Ossorio, Peter G.","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/16889","","","","","","","","","","","","","U183071307077_narv_ossorioPeter_37-5_galaxies_a.mp4","https://ark.colorado.edu/ark:/47540/dx5j7k82z7dq","COU:3855 | Box: 37 | Tape: 05","","","","","Spring, 2024","video/mp4","https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/video/mp4","reformatted digital","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.
